# Agile Manifesto

En 2001, 17 développeurs au centre du mouvement agile se réunissent pour échanger librement autour des différentes méthodes agiles.

Cette rencontre s'achève avec la publication du manifeste agile.

> Manifesto for Agile Software Development
>
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
> **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Les 12 principes de l'Agile Manifesto

[http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

> _We follow these principles:_
>
> 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>
> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
>
> 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a   
> preference to the shorter timescale.
>
> 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
>
> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals.   
> Give them the environment and support they need,  and trust them to get the job done.
>
> 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
>
> 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
>
> 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.   
> The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
>
> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
>
> 10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
>
> 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
>
> 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
